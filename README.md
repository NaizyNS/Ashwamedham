# Aswamedham
Aswamedham is a reverse quiz game which is purely vocal based. In this game user got asked to think of
anyone prominent personality belonging to any part of the world. This person could be dead or alive.
Computer would then go on to guess the name of that celebrity by asking the user a series of twenty-one
questions which user would have to answer yes or no. The contribution of this work is to design a strategy
to play Aswamedham which the computer will never lose.
